Usually, you only need to know the 'front-end_format.xml',There are two steps
to make a dictioanry.
1) create a xx.xml accoring to front-end_format.xml.
2) use AlConvert to convert xx.xml to xx.aldict.
   # AlConvert xx.xml   xx
   AlConvert shall create a dictionary: xx.aldict.

doc/alphadict_en-ch.xml is a example, You can use them or refrence them to build your dictionary.

AlphaDict don't support some dict formats directly but provides some tools to convert

    /usr/local/share/alphadict/tools  -- linux, unix
    'installing direcotry'/tools -- win32.

stardict

1) put all the files of startdict's dictionary to a directory like foo.
   foo/ [foo_xx.idx, foo_xx.ifo, foo_xx.dict]
2) # python stardict_to_aldictxml.py  foo/foo_xx   foo_xx.xml
3) # AlConvert foo_xx.xml  foo_xx
     you will get foo_xx.aldict
